**Overview of the Student Grades Management Project**

Project Objective
The objective of this project is to create a Python-based application to help track and manage student grades. The program will allow users to input grades for various subjects or assignments, calculate the average grade, and display relevant information such as the overall grade, letter grade, and GPA.

**Key Features**

**Grade Tracking:** Enable users to add, update, or remove grades for specific subjects or assignments.

**Grade Calculations:** Compute the average of all entered grades.
Determine the corresponding letter grade (A, B, C, etc.) based on predefined criteria.
Calculate the GPA (Grade Point Average) based on the average grade.

**Informative Output:** Display a list of all entered grades.
Show the average grade, letter grade, and GPA in a well-formatted summary.

**User-Friendly Interface:** Provide a menu-driven system to perform tasks easily.
Allow the user to navigate between options and exit gracefully.

**Data Validation:** Validate user inputs to ensure grades are within a valid range (0–100).
Handle invalid inputs with clear error messages.
Functional Flow

**Welcome Screen:** Display a welcome message and explain the program’s functionality.

**Input Phase:** Prompt the user to input grades for various subjects or assignments.
Allow users to view or update previously entered grades.

**Processing Phase:** Calculate the average grade.
Convert the average into a letter grade based on standard grading scales.
Compute the GPA using a 4.0 scale.

**Output Phase:** Display a summary of all grades and calculated metrics.
Provide options to perform additional actions or exit the program.

**Technology Stack**

**Programming Language:** Python

**Libraries:** No external libraries are required (uses built-in functionality).

**Target Audience**

Students wanting a simple tool to track their grades.
Teachers or tutors managing grades for multiple subjects.
Beginner programmers looking for a practical Python project.

**Key Learning Outcomes**

**Data Structures:** Using dictionaries to store grades for different subjects.

**Mathematical Calculations:** Computing averages and converting numeric grades to letter grades and GPA.

**Control Flow:** Implementing menu-driven navigation with if, elif, and loops.

**Error Handling:** Using try and except to handle invalid input gracefully.

**Possible Enhancements**

**Multiple Students:** Extend the program to manage grades for multiple students.

**Persistence:** Save and load grades to/from a file for reuse across sessions.

**Graphical Interface:** Implement a GUI using libraries like Tkinter or PyQt.

**Analytics:** Provide insights, such as the highest or lowest grades, or trends over time.
